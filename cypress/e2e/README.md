# 🚀 Welcome to our Cypress Testing Universe! 🚀

Fasten your seatbelts, we're about to launch into the world of End-to-End (E2E) testing!

## 🗺️ Project Map 🗺️

Here's the lay of the land in our `cypress` directory:

cypress
├── fixtures - This is where we keep our test data.
├── integration - The main hub of our E2E tests.
│ ├── places - All tests related to the places in our app.
│ ├── sessions - Tests for the work sessions.
│ ├── profiles - For all things profile-related.
│ └── authentication - Here be the tests related to logging in and out.
├── plugins - Any additional config or plugins.
└── support - Custom commands or commonly used functions.

## 🎭 The Playwrights 🎭

We all contribute to writing the script for our application's performance on the World Wide Stage. Remember, a good playwright writes with the audience (i.e., other developers and our future selves) in mind. Keep your tests clear, descriptive, and as simple as possible.

## 🧙‍♂️ Naming Magic Spells 🧙‍♂️

Our naming convention for the test files is as follows: `feature_detail.spec.js`. We should use this format because:

1. It's kind of magical.
2. It gives us a quick understanding of what the test is about.
3. It makes it easier to find the file you're looking for.
4. It makes it display the test icon

Another example: `session_subscribe.spec.js` ⚡

## 🌈 The Pot of Gold at the End of the Rainbow 🌈

Well-written tests are the pot of gold at the end of the development rainbow. They help us sleep at night knowing that our app is running smoothly and they make it easier to add new features without breaking old ones. So keep calm, and test on! 🍀

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
